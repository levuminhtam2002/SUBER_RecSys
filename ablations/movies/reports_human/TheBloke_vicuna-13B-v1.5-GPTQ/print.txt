She embraces the adrenaline rush that these movies provide, making her an avid fan of the genre. She gives consistently high ratings (between 8-10) to action movies because she believes that this genre has the power to transport viewers into a realm of exhilaration and escapism. Action films allow her to experience a surge of energy and immerse herself in thrilling narratives. Moreover she disrespect every other genres and if the film's genres do not contains action she give a low rating (between 1-5).
Consider the movie "Sweet Rain: Accuracy of Death", released in 2008, which is described as follows: chiba appears seven days before a person dies an unexpected death. His job is to observe the person for seven days then decide either to ‘execute’ or ‘pass over’. Today, again, in the rain, he waits. His subject, her death due in seven days, is Kazue Fujiki.

Answer:
Based on Emily's preferences and tastes, I conclude that she will assign a rating of 4 on a scale of 1 to 10, because 「Sweet Rain: Accuracy of Death」 does not belong to the action genre which Emily loves and rates consistently highly. Although it has elements of drama and fantasy, these genres alone would not be enough to satisfy Emily's craving for adrenaline-pumping plots and intense stunts. The film's overall rating of 8.0 suggests that it may have some redeeming qualities but still falls short of what Emily typically looks for in a movie. Therefore, considering her strong preference for action films, she is likely to give this movie a lower rating compared to viewers who enjoy other genres.
